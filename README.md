# cigar_connoisseur
A fragment recruitment plot tool 

Takes up to three .sam alignment files and converts the cigar string in each to a percent mapping identity and then plots these using matplot lib. 

I originally wrote this script to explore how well certain metagenomic data aligned to specific reference sequences. Specifically, I wanted to know how well metagenomic sequences taken from coral reef lagoons mapped to different genomic strains of the picocyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus marinus.
